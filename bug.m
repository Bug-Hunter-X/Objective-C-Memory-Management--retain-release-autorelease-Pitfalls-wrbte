In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves the misuse of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Specifically, forgetting to release objects manually after use, especially when dealing with objects created using `alloc` or `new`, leads to memory leaks.  Another issue is double releasing an object (e.g. sending `release` twice), causing crashes. Consider the following example:

```objectivec
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... use myObject ...
[myObject release]; // Correct - releasing manually
```

Failure to release `myObject` would cause a memory leak.  Conversely, releasing it multiple times results in a crash.
