To avoid memory leaks, ensure that every `alloc` or `new` call is paired with a `release` or that autorelease is used effectively within appropriate contexts like autorelease pools.   To prevent crashes, avoid calling `release` on an object more than once.

In modern Objective-C development with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), these manual memory management issues are largely eliminated. However, understanding these concepts remains crucial for maintaining compatibility with older code and comprehending the underlying mechanisms.

Here's a corrected version:

```objectivec
@autoreleasepool {
    MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // ... use myObject ...
    [myObject release];
}
```

Using ARC:
```objectivec
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... use myObject ...
// ARC handles the release automatically
```

Note:  The `@autoreleasepool` block helps manage autoreleased objects effectively.
